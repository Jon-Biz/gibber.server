gibber.server
=============

This is the server component for Gibber. After downloading, run `npm install` in the top level of the repo to install necessary dependencies. These dependencies are highly version specific in most cases, so don't go updating any of these modules.

To use from top level of repo: 

`cd node_modules/gibber.server`
`node . 8080`

You can substitute a port of your choice for `8080` in the above line.
